Basic

1.unzip titanic.zip (when using mac terminal, it is done automatically)
2.ls -l train.csv
3.head -5 train.csv, tail -5 train.scv
4.cat train.csv or less train.csv
5.Yes we need to write a script for that.
6.create file ( touch train_tail.csv) print last lines and save output ( tail -5 train.csv > train_tail.csv)
7.sed -n 3,5p train.csv
8.This command displays disc usage with an entry for each file in a file hierarchi, sort the files numerically in reverse order,
displaying the count of first 20 lines
9.split -l 20 train.csv new


Write a loop to iterate over lists 

2.Write a loop that prints name, dimensions and first 2 lines for each of the .csv (file print.sh)

#!/bin/bash
#Loop that prints the name, dimension and first 2 lines
for entry in ultratrail/*.csv 
do
FILESIZE=$(stat -c%s "$entry")
echo "Filename:$entry has $FILESIZE bytes"
n=1
   while read line;
do
      if [ $n -gt2 ]; then
                 break
      fi
      echo "Line no. $n : $line"
            let "n++"
      done < $entry
done


3.Write a loop that copies each of the .csv files to a backup folder(file p3.sh)


#!/bin/bash
for entry in ultratrail/*.csv
do
directory="ultratrail/backups"
if [ ! -d "$directory" ]; then mkdir "$directory"; fi
/bin/cp "$entry" "$directory" 
done

Reach

1. Write a script that suggests the data formats ....., then create the file (file reach1.sh)

#!/bin/bash

echo "You can create files of the following types: xcv,xlxs,pdf,doc and txt"

echo -n "Please enter the extension of the file to create; "
read filetype

 touch selected."$filetype"

echo "A filename selected.$filetype was created."


2. Write a script that keeps only the first N number of lines .....(file reach2.sh)

#!/bin/bash
n=$1
((n++))

for entry in ultratrail/*.csv
 do
sed -i "$n, $d"$entry

done
